# Snake [New Version]
Old good Snake game but with few improvements written in C++.

### Technologies
It it written in ***C++*** and [SFML library](https://github.com/SFML/SFML).

### What's new to the old one?
There is a list of improvements unavailable in classic Snake.
* Light fruits will add points, dark will take them.
* Every 8 second laser is shot and it can cut out snake. There is also a counter which shows time left for next shoot.
* If player touch laser with mouse he lose his cutting abilities.
* Clicking the spacebar turns on slow-motion mode. It is helpful in avoid the laser or picking up small fruits. Slow-motion requires energy which regenerates by itself.
